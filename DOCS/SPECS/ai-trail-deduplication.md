# AI Trail Deduplication Specification

## Overview
This specification outlines a simple process to prevent duplicate trail entries during trail creation. When using AI to assist in creating new trails, the system will perform basic checks against existing trails to avoid duplicates.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Basic Trail Matching
- **Simple Location Check**
  - Compare trail starting points within a reasonable radius (e.g., 2km)
  - Use basic distance calculation between two points
  - Only check the trail's starting coordinates

- **Name Similarity**
  - Basic string comparison
  - Check for exact matches and simple variations
  - Example: "Mount Whitney Trail" vs "Mt Whitney Trail"

### 2. Implementation Details

#### Data Structure
```typescript
interface TrailComparisonData {
  name: string;
  coordinates: string; // Starting point only
}
```

#### Matching Process
1. During trail creation only:
   - Get existing trails within the same region/area
   - Compare trail name and starting point
   - Alert user if potential duplicate found
   - Allow user to proceed or modify

### 3. API Changes

#### Simple Response Format
```typescript
interface AITrailResponse {
  suggestions: Trail[];
  duplicates: {
    count: number;
    names: string[];
  };
}
```

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Storage Interface
- Use existing trail query methods
- No need for special indexing
- Simple coordinate-based filtering

#### Distance Calculation
```typescript
function calculateDistance(coord1: string, coord2: string): number {
  // Simple Haversine formula implementation
  // Returns distance in kilometers
}
```

### 5. Frontend Changes
- Show duplicate warnings in trail creation form
- Display nearby existing trails
- Allow user to continue if needed

## Success Criteria
- Catch obvious duplicates during creation
- Performance under 1 second for checks
- Simple, maintainable implementation
- Clear user feedback

## Implementation Notes
1. Keep the solution simple and focused
2. Avoid complex algorithms or scoring systems
3. Prioritize maintainability over precision
4. Use basic JavaScript/TypeScript functions
5. Focus on preventing obvious duplicates only

## Future Considerations
- This simple approach can be enhanced later if needed
- Current implementation focuses on basic validation
- Additional matching criteria can be added gradually
- Maintain simplicity unless requirements change significantly

## Why This Approach?
1. Easy to maintain by developers of all skill levels
2. Uses familiar JavaScript/TypeScript concepts
3. No complex spatial databases or algorithms
4. Clear, straightforward implementation
5. Balances effectiveness with simplicity
