# Feature Integration Specification

## Overview
This document outlines how the User Dashboard, AI Trail Deduplication, and Offline Map Functionality work together to provide a seamless user experience.

## Integration Points

### 1. Trail Creation Flow
- **User Dashboard**
  - Provides the trail creation interface
  - Displays user preferences for trail suggestions
  - Shows saved trails and favorites

- **AI Deduplication**
  - Only activates during trail creation
  - Checks for duplicates before saving
  - Provides immediate feedback in creation form
  - Does not affect general trail browsing or recommendations

- **Offline Support**
  - Caches trail creation form for offline access
  - Queues new trails for sync when online
  - Stores map tiles for the creation area

### 2. Data Management
- **User Profile Data**
  - Dashboard manages user preferences
  - Stored locally for offline access
  - Synced when connection restored

- **Trail Data**
  - Saved trails available offline
  - Duplicate detection runs only on creation
  - Map tiles cached for saved trails

### 3. User Experience Flow
1. User logs in (requires online connection)
2. Dashboard loads with cached data (works offline)
3. During trail creation:
   - AI duplicate check (requires online)
   - Map interaction (works offline with cached tiles)
   - Form submission (works offline, syncs later)

## Implementation Priorities
1. Complete Personal Information section in dashboard
2. Implement basic offline storage
3. Add duplicate detection during creation
4. Enhance offline capabilities progressively

## Success Criteria
- Features work independently when needed
- Clear user feedback for online/offline states
- No conflicts between duplicate detection and recommendations
- Smooth transition between online/offline modes

## Maintenance Considerations
- Keep duplicate detection simple and focused
- Use progressive enhancement for offline features
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Follow KISS and DRY principles
